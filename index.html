    <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.<b> Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:<b> a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, <b>a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, <b>though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.<b> A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).<b> Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.<b> For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. <b>Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea.</p>
